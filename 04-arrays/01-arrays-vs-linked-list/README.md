## What are the Differences

- Usability
  - It's much harder to insert into an array than it is in a linked list
  - Linear search is the only means of traversing a linked list
  - You've got so many other means of traversing an array
- Time
- Space
  - For an array, if you want to store up to a thousand items, you have to allocate that memory up front.
  - A linked list you allocate memory as you push a node into it.
