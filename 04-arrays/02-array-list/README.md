## What is an Array List

Think of it as an array that can grow

- Usability:
  - Great for getting, pushing and popping
  - Terrible at insertion in the middle of a list, enqueueing and dequeueing

## Which on Would you Rather Use?

It depends on the situation:

- If you're a pushing or popping a linked list or an array list work well
- If you're enqueueing or dequeueing then just use a linked list
